							<p>"Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall" Confucius. This quote greets me as I walk in and out of my front door.  You may think I might become ‘house blind’ to this greeting but, unlike many other things in my home, this quote always catches my attention.  I initially hung this quote on my wall thinking it would be a good incentive for my children...couldn’t hurt right?  I could not have known then that shortly I would embark on a new career.  Learning the art of web development certainly tested my ability to persist.
							</p>
							<p id="para2">
							Growing up in the Skagit Valley, situated half way between Seattle and Vancouver, in the 1970’s and 1980’s meant spending summers digging bulbs, picking strawberries, and rowing spinach.  By the age of nine it was off to work the day after school ended and continued through
							The very end of summer break.  I remember the feeling of relief when the new school year started.  Without those experiences I wonder if I would value as much the feeling of pride when you have persisted through a very difficult endeavor.
							I am proud of this most recent accomplishment as well as past accomplishments.  I graduated from the University of Western Washington with a B.A. in Education and Social Sciences.  After which I moved to Hermosa Beach, CA with my childhood friend.  I almost immediately found employment in the incredibly fast growing business of computer distribution.  After a few short years of working at Merisel, El Segundo based computer distributor, I was recruited by Ingram Micro.  I spent the next ten years working as a Product Manager and Senior Product Manager at Ingram Micro, world’s largest computer distributor based in Orange County.  Three weeks before the birth of my first child I quit working and began the most incredible journey of becoming a parent. Fourteen years later and I am still becoming
							A parent.  It is important to recognize with parenting there is no end point and you are never quite sure you have done your job well.  And that is OK.  There are always
							Ways to improve, new philosophies and methods, and things you would do differently given the chance. 
							When my family and friends inevitably ask ‘Why coding?  That seems so difficult.  I could never learn to code.’ I explain
							It simply takes some persistence, willingness to learn new technologies and methods, and ability to reflect on what you may do differently on your next project.
